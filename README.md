## Challenge Agility
Every challenge is unique. Therefore each challenge is managed according to the needs of its stakeholders and the outcomes they desire. Challenges can range from being informal to formal in the way that they are governed. Challenge activities can range from being light-touch, with periodic touchpoints to being intensive - with in-person workshops or hackathon sessions. 

While the challenges may range in the way they are carried out, it is important the desired outcomes are clear so everyone is aligned, working towards a common goal.
